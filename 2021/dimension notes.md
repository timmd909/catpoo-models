# Important dimensions

* Battery - 150 x 50 x 25 (add +10 for the wires out)
* Raspberry Pi - 160 x 10 x 50  (includes wires coming out)
* Arduino - 110 x 80 x 50 (includes wires coming out)

# Basic Design Guidelines

* Main robot cube
	* Outer dimensions: 175 x 175 x 175
		* Wall thickness 6mm (sheets vary between 5 and 6mm)
	* Mounting holes on all sides in a square 160 x 160
		* whether to use screws, or squares for use w/ 3d printed removal
		* squares probably are fine (can also be used w/ screws + washers)
	* Cut out as much material as possible except within 15 mm borders
* Drive train
	* Should mount on the 160 x 160 pattern (don't forget lock washers)
	* While it'll be 3 wheel holonomic now, I'd like to be able to swap out later
		* One day, it'd be cool to have a amphibious one...
* Display and Speakers
	* Should be done as a hat on top of the robot cube
	* Should be done separately and not hold up the main part of the robot

# Goals

* Learn ROS for resume padding
